Colabo is an online collaborative collage board where ideas meet and display.

It provides an unlimited canvas where students can add texts, images, and 3D models to explain their ideas and facilitate group discussions. 
The app is linked to the Sketchfab API, which provides easy access to abundant open-source 3D models online. 
Therefore, it is particularly helpful for subjects such as interior design, architecture, culture and history, science, and etc., where contextualization is essential for the area of studies. 
All the data is automatically saved on cloud, and the boards are shard instantly.
